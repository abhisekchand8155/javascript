                    2-Bollean :-we get the bollean value like true/false
                    3-Undefined :-data is not define
                    4-Null :-in this datatype we get null for the value means nothing.
                    5-bigInt :-in bigInt we get big intiger value "-999999999 to +999999999" on the above
                    6-String :-it is a type of datatype that can be hold some character like "name or word  .... etc"

                    -Reference datatype are the type of datatype which can hold multiple element in a single time
                    -Reference datatypes are  -> array, object , Function

                    1. Array :-
                        -Array is a datatype where we can store similar type of data is a contigious memory location
                        -array index starting from "0"
                        ex- let arr=["ram", "hari" , "sita", "bharat"]
                                        0      1        2       3
                        

                    2.Object :-
                        -Object is a reference type of datatype where we can store more than one element in a single entity
                        -mainly objects are working on (key:value) pair

                        ex:-
                        let emp1={
                        "name" : "sonu kumar"
                        "age"  : "75"
                        "address" : "bhubaneswar"
                        "mobile number" : "7809148927"
                        "salary" : "5600023"
                        }

                        -in the above example we can see that the left hand side element are the keys and the right hand side element are values so we can tell that about object is a key:value pair structure
